## This is a heading

As a mature student at 25 I made the initial change from IT and unpaid care work to taking up a Access to HE course during lockdown debating the treatment of offenders when arrested by the police watching police interceptors with my grandmother. While maintaing the caring duties she suggested I should go back to studying and take a course, it was after the lockdown had been lifted I took the advice, applied to college, and passed my access to HE and gaining a placement at unviersity which I am currently studying my first year as a mature student who has no legal connections and little legal knowledge, embracing the elements of studying and adapting to a legal career has been quite the change and with this portfolio I can document this journey.

As a new change in life I wanted to take this oppurtunity as a fresh start, do things diffeently and have a outlook while also bringing skills forward from non-legal work and experience that other may not be able to bring to the table and enhance overall personal development and commit to more self reflection.

My goal with this website overall not only to showcase myself as a person and to enhance network and potential work oppurtunities and collaborations but also enhance other soft-skills while helping other students who may be experiencing similar issues, I hope the content on this website will help others in the future.
